# GC-GTM
we propose a novel framework called GC-GTM (Generative-Convergent GTM) which is a modified GTM framework that integrates technology–market convergence in the mapping process and leverages generative AI to interpret latent vacancies. This dual enhancement addresses the limitations of conventional GTM in both discovery and interpretation. The framework conceptualizes the current technology–market configuration as a baseline state, and the unexplored convergence areas as a latent opportunity space. We explore keyword-level technology and market convergence. Then, GTM is employed to generate a two-dimensional technology–market vacancy map in the latent space, where each vacancy is inverse-mapped to its latent keyword distribution and translated into textual descriptions via generative modeling.

1. For transparency and reproducibility, only the essential components of the research pipeline are released.

3. The workflow is organized into four Jupyter notebooks (1)–(4). For reference, the keyword vector matrix used in step (3) — GTM mapping — is provided as a CSV file.

3. In addition, the CSV files containing the five-run averages (± standard deviation) of the novelty, feasibility, and trend-fit metrics are included as part of the research outputs.
